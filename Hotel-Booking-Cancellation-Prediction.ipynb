    "## Predicting Hotel Cancellations\n",
    "Booking cancellations can significantly affect demand management strategies in the hospitality sector. The internet sees over 140 million bookings annually, with a significant proportion of hotel bookings being made through popular travel websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome the problems caused by booking cancellations, hotels implement rigid cancellation policies, inventory management, and overbooking strategies, which can also have a negative influence on revenue and reputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the reservation has been canceled, there is almost nothing to be done and it creates discomfort for many Hotels and Hotel Technology companies. Therefore, predicting reservations which might get canceled and preventing these cancellations will create a surplus revenue for both Hotels and Hotel Technology companies.\n",

    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine if there was a way to predict which guests are likely to cancel their hotel bookings. Using Machine Learning with Python, this is possible. By predicting cancellations, hotels can generate additional revenue, improve forecasting accuracy, and reduce uncertainty in business management decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those who want to follow a structured approach while working on a machine learning project, this analysis provides a comprehensive guide. It covers the entire process of solving a real-world machine learning project, from understanding the business problem to deploying the model on the cloud."
